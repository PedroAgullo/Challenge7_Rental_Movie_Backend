## Sample 1

### index.js
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
const router = require('./router');

app.use(router);
app.use(express.json());

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Node server running on http://localhost:${port}`));

```

This jss file:
1. imported the **Express.js** library,
2. saved its functionalities on "app",
3. selected 3000 as the server's port and
4. linked **router.js**.

Then, the router.js' and express.json()' functionalities were "used", or, we assume, loaded in memory.

**app.listen() _started_ a local node.js server that uses the 3000 port.**
<br>

### router.js
```
const router = require('express').Router();

const moviesRouter = require('./routes/moviesRouter.js');
const seriesRouter = require('./routes/seriesRouter.js');

router.use('/movies', moviesRouter);
router.use('/series', seriesRouter);


module.exports = router;

```
This js file **imports the .Router() utility from Express.js**, which is used to **link the moviesRouter and seriesRouter paths, and therefore their content, to index.js**. In this sense, **router.js is merely a link between the main application (index.js) to its dependencies.**
